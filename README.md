# Casewalker (Python3 script)
Generate expression files like a pro, write them in a single json and generate the documentation and expression files automagically.

## Announcements
- First version released, simple generation of facttype sentences in .exp files
- Feed casewalker.py with a json file and run!

## Usage
1. Download casewalker.py and feitzinnen.json to your desktop
1. Navigate to the downloaded file (e.g. cd ~/Desktop/casewalker)
1. Type `which python3` and copy the path to the next command..
1. Open up a terminal and navigate to `cd ~/Desktop/casewalker`
1. Start the script using command: `/usr/bin/python3 casewalker.py -f feitzinnen.json`
1. The script creates an output folder and creates seperate .exp files for you
1. Enjoy! The next release will generate markdown documentation of the json data as well (and maybe introduce a UI)!
